# IcesiPalace

IcesiPalace is an innovative online platform designed to facilitate the buying and selling of goods among college students. Inspired by Facebook Marketplace, this platform allows users to browse and post ads seamlessly. Our project is divided into two main components: the front-end and the back-end.

## Project Overview

### Key Features:
- User-friendly interface for posting and browsing ads
- Secure image storage and retrieval
- Robust database management for user and post data

### Technologies Used:
- **Front-end**: React and Bootstrap
- **Back-end**: Spring Boot, MySQL, Google Cloud Storage

### Learning Outcomes:
Throughout the development of IcesiPalace, our team gained valuable experience in:
- Utilizing Google Cloud for database management and image storage
- Implementing Spring Boot for back-end development
- Building an attractive and responsive front-end with React and Bootstrap
- Integrating front-end and back-end services efficiently

    git clone https://github.com/Rony7v7/IcesiPalace
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

    ```bash

4. **Start the Front-end Server:**

    ```bash
    cd ./icesipalace-frontend
    npm start
    ```

### Back-end Setup

**Note:** The back-end relies on Google Cloud services which are no longer available, so the back-end cannot be run locally at this time.

1. **Navigate to the Back-end Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd icesipalace-backend
    ```

2. **Run the Maven Build Tool:**

    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

3. **Environment Variables:**
    Ensure you configure the required environment variables for connecting to different services. Details can be found scattered throughout the codebase.

### Services Used:
- **Google Cloud Buckets**: For image storage
- **MySQL**: As the database for storing user and post information
